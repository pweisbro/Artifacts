# Artifacts

A home for small interactive web apps. The homepage (`index.html`) shows every app with a live preview; tap one to open it, and the grid button inside each app brings you back.

Open https://pweisbro.github.io/artifacts/ in Safari, then use **Share → Add to Home Screen** with **Open as Web App** on. After the first visit everything works offline.

## Apps

### Spectrum Bench

`spectrum-bench.html` is a playable optics bench: light sources, prisms, lenses, flat and curved mirrors, diffraction gratings, color filters, beam splitters, slits and screens.

### Resonant Ink

`resonant-ink.html` is a multi-touch fluid simulation. Stir the dye with as many fingers as you like, and tune vorticity, viscosity, dye density, fade and diffusion. Colors, bloom and a kaleidoscope mirror are adjustable. Audio-reactive spots fire from a frequency band you pick on the live spectrum, with an adjustable sensitivity. The sound can come from the built-in demo beat, a song file, or the microphone.

The microphone needs a secure (https) host such as GitHub Pages and your permission. Songs play locally and are never uploaded. Settings are remembered in the browser.

## Updating

To update an app, replace its page with the new version. Pages refresh themselves the next time you open them online.

To add an app, put its page next to the others and follow the checklist in `CLAUDE.md`: an entry in the homepage's `APPS` list, a button back home, and a line in `sw.js` for offline use.
